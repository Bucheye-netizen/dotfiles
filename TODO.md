# TODO

    - Fix broken keybinds for navigating tabs.
    - Window resizing using above navigation keybinds.

- Fix file manager used for downloads. 

- Apply performance improvements described [here](https://artemis.sh/2022/09/18/wayland-from-an-x-apologist.html).

- SDDM is broken, silently failing and core dumping (see `journalctl` logs). Remove use `greetd` instead.
